# TensorFlowCert
The goal of this certificate is to provide everyone in the world the opportunity to showcase their expertise in ML in an increasingly AI-driven global job market. This certificate in TensorFlow development is intended as a foundational certificate for students, developers, and data scientists who want to demonstrate practical machine learning skills through the building and training of models using TensorFlow.

The program consists of an assessment exam developed by the TensorFlow team. Developers who pass the exam can join our Certificate Network and display their certificate and badges on their resume, GitHub, and social media platforms including LinkedIn, making it easy to share their level of TensorFlow expertise with the world.

Stay tuned as we are working to add certificate programs for more advanced and specialized TensorFlow practitioners. Check back soon for more information.

## Who is the TensorFlow Certificate for?
This level one certificate exam tests a developers foundational knowledge of integrating machine learning into tools and applications. The certificate program requires an understanding of building TensorFlow models using Computer Vision, Convolutional Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and real-world image data and strategies.

In order to successfully take the exam, test takers should be comfortable with:

- Foundational principles of ML and Deep Learning
- Building ML models in TensorFlow 2.x
- Building image recognition, object detection, text recognition algorithms with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks
- Using real-world images in different shapes and sizes to visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy
- Exploring strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts
- Applying neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow
