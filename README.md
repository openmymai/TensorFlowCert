# TensorFlowCert
The goal of this certificate is to provide everyone in the world the opportunity to showcase their expertise in ML in an increasingly AI-driven global job market. This certificate in TensorFlow development is intended as a foundational certificate for students, developers, and data scientists who want to demonstrate practical machine learning skills through the building and training of models using TensorFlow.

The program consists of an assessment exam developed by the TensorFlow team. Developers who pass the exam can join our Certificate Network and display their certificate and badges on their resume, GitHub, and social media platforms including LinkedIn, making it easy to share their level of TensorFlow expertise with the world.

Stay tuned as we are working to add certificate programs for more advanced and specialized TensorFlow practitioners. Check back soon for more information.
